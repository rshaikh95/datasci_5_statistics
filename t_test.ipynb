I wanted to see if smoking impacted BMI in people who work privately. Using data from only people who worked privately, I obtained the data for people who smoked and never smoked and found out the T-stat and p-value. Finally I obtained the mean BMI prevalence for smokers and non-smokers and was able to conclude the following.\n",
